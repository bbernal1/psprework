    <p>
        I've always liked computers and how they make our lives more convenient. During school, I had to do some computer programming and that was when I realized that I would like to do it as a career.
        I started doing some web development tutorials and I liked how I could see the results of my coding visually on a web page. This experience led me to apply for this course and I am excited to become a software developer.
